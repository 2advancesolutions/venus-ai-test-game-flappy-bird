# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Instant Play (3 ways)

### Method 1: Double-click (Easiest)
1. Double-click `index.html`
2. Game opens in your default browser
3. Click or press SPACE to start!

### Method 2: Local Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Node.js (if you have npx)
npx serve .

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8000**

### Method 3: VS Code (If you're using it)
1. Install "Live Server" extension
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

## 🎮 Controls

- **Desktop**: Click mouse or press SPACEBAR
- **Mobile**: Tap the screen
- **Goal**: Avoid pipes, don't hit the ground

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Game won't load?**
- Make sure `game.jsx` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try using a local server instead of opening directly

**Bird not responding?**
- Make sure you clicked "START GAME" first
- Try pressing SPACE instead of clicking
- Refresh the page and try again

**Performance issues?**
- Close other browser tabs
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- Check if hardware acceleration is enabled

## 📱 Mobile Testing

To test on your phone:
1. Start local server on your computer
2. Find your computer's local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
3. On phone, visit: `http://YOUR-IP:8000`
4. Make sure phone and computer are on same WiFi

## 🎯 Game Tips

- **Timing is everything**: Don't spam the jump button
- **Watch ahead**: Look at upcoming pipes, not just the bird
- **Stay centered**: Middle of the screen is usually safest
- **Practice patience**: Small taps are better than big jumps

## 🏆 High Score Challenge

- **0-5 points**: You tried!
- **5-10 points**: Getting the hang of it
- **10-20 points**: Pretty good!
- **20-30 points**: Impressive!
- **30+ points**: Are you a robot?

Good luck! Don't throw your device when you rage quit. 😅
